2015-06-04 [X] Autocopying on focus lost/gain
2015-06-08 [X] Vitality  <F24>/<F25>
:> Too rigid, can't adapt for all cases. Must rewrite completely.
	https://github.com/sjl/vitality.vim/blob/master/plugin/vitality.vim
	>[_] find why mapping in cnoremap such a pain
[_] I'm really don't understand why he does that in autoload/tmux_...
	:= seems like it was autosaving/loading buffers on focus events

TERMS

		: <Change sources to implement>: VIM launch will enable notification of mouse
		: events to the terminal (set mouse = ...). When it will stop, it will
		: turn off this notification
		> But how to do it less harmful?
		: So even bash will not show those sequences and interpret them instead?
		: Maybe, zsh has built-in ability for focus lost? And I will no need to use urxvt?
		: Think about how to disable those commands (or make them not harmful) if plugin is absent

		Integrate
		: For example a common problem when we're working in the console is to copy text
		: on a remote console (ssh vim) and edit the content locally. By this approach
		: is feasible by defining a sequence OSC "clipboard" qu'URxvt recover to
		: transfer the contents into the CLIPBOARD selection of the local X11 server.
		: Something like:
		:	echo -en "\033]777;CLIPBOARD;ON\077Ceci est mon texte Ã  copier\033]777;CLIPBOARD;OFF\077"
		: Besides, the idea is already a little set up in a little-known plugin urxvt, clipboard-osc.


>> Seems like, I can't integrate focus events for urxvt with tmux.
	Case 1: intercept standard '\033[?1004l' command for focus enable/disable
	Case 2: change focus enable/disable sequences which tmux sends to urxvt
	: No results:  urxvt perl hook "CSI" sequence


GENERAL
	2015-06-04 [X] Check if that codes are in spec now  :> Yes (xterm, iTerm2)
	: FocusIn/FocusOut control sequences, which uses CSI O and CSI I
		https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/1917
	| Maybe, create new button in my xkbmap and use it somehow with escape sequences?

BUG
	2015-06-07 [X] BUG: Focus not triggered -- FocusIn works not always?
	:= Seems like FocusIn for next vim triggered before FocusOut for previous.
	:  So next vim always copies previous content of "+ register, instead of new.
	:> Resolved, adding delay to 'urxvt/ext/focus-term'
		2015-06-07 [X] two vims on split screen -- copying works only in one direction
		2015-06-07 [X] two vims on different workspaces -- works FocusOut->+, but not FoucIn for another
	[_] BUG: returning into vim drops visual selection -- so 'gv' after vnoremap is not enough?
	2015-06-08 [X] BUG: cursor don't change form in insert.
	:> urxvt don't have 'vbar' cursor
	[_] BUG: on <C-y> with specific reg content, may be error msgs produced.
		: So, for FocusOut/In use function version w/o printing
	[_] BUG: cursor not changing shape inside tmux
	[_] BUG: can't start vim, if '*' contains big (>12K) json file content
		: How to mitigate such?
	[_] BUG: when exiting vim, text is not copied in '+'. VimLeavePre don't work?


CHECK
	[_] Copying through // 2015-06-09
		[_] ssh
		[_] tmux
			: WARNING: when opening vim in tmux through ssh -- check dst terminal,
			: and probably disable my plugin
		[_] ssh+tmux
		[_] tmux+ssh
	[_] Focus codes for another terminal emulators -- see their specs
		: check default codes for urxvt too

TODO
	[_] Tmux :> must additionally send it's own events when moving through windows/pans.
		[_] SEE tmux already integrated focus feature:  focus-events [on|off]
			: http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi/OpenBSD-current/man1/tmux.1?query=tmux&sec=1
	[_] FIXME some my functions copies directly into '+', then on focus toggle
		: their values will be replaced by current @". Need remake my functions
		: or think about some mechanics to prevent such behaviour?
		: Maybe copying into '*'?
	[_] ADD travis-ci
		(kana) http://whileimautomaton.net/
	WARNING when opening new terminal ($mod+u) vim is not opened yet, so buffer
		will not be copied in @"! You must keep yank shortcuts for such cases.
	[_] TODO: optionaly copy buffers on VimEnter/VimLeavePre also.
	[_] FIX: don't copy in @p if it's equal to @" (then several focusing
		events will not replace it with @+)
	[_] ADD checking for gvim -- then use guicursor options for color and shape
	[_] vim cursor for replace mode -- t_SR
		http://andrewscala.com/vimscript/
	[_] What will happend, if you disable focusing and accidentaly exit?


TEST
	[_] Check :wa! with dirty new buffer in vim w/o file to save
		: to implement autosaving on FocusOut
	[_] FIXME: erasing changes scenario
		copied in clipboard, pressed $mSd+X, clipboard edited, change focus from vim
			as result my edits will be replaced with current @" content
