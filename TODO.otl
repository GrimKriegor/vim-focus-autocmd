		: <Change sources to implement>: VIM launch will enable notification of mouse
		: events to the terminal (set mouse = ...). When it will stop, it will
		: turn off this notification
		> But how to do it less harmful?
		: So even bash will not show those sequences and interpret them instead?
		: Maybe, zsh has built-in ability for focus lost? And I will no need to use urxvt?
		: Think about how to disable those commands (or make them not harmful) if plugin is absent

		Integrate
		: For example a common problem when we're working in the console is to copy text
		: on a remote console (ssh vim) and edit the content locally. By this approach
		: is feasible by defining a sequence OSC "clipboard" qu'URxvt recover to
		: transfer the contents into the CLIPBOARD selection of the local X11 server.
		: Something like:
		: 	echo -en "\033]777;CLIPBOARD;ON\077Ceci est mon texte Ã  copier\033]777;CLIPBOARD;OFF\077"
		: Besides, the idea is already a little set up in a little-known plugin urxvt, clipboard-osc.


GENERAL
	2015-06-04 [X] Check if that codes are in spec now  :> Yes (xterm, iTerm2)
	: FocusIn/FocusOut control sequences, which uses CSI O and CSI I
		https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/1917
	| Maybe, create new button in my xkbmap and use it somehow with escape sequences?

BUG
	2015-06-07 [X] BUG: Focus not triggered -- FocusIn works not always?
	:= Seems like FocusIn for next vim triggered before FocusOut for previous.
	:  So next vim always copies previous content of "+ register, instead of new.
	:> Resolved, adding delay to 'urxvt/ext/focus-term'
		2015-06-07 [X] two vims on split screen -- copying works only in one direction
		2015-06-07 [X] two vims on different workspaces -- works FocusOut->+, but not FoucIn for another
	[_] BUG: returning into vim drops visual selection -- so 'gv' after vnoremap is not enough?
	2015-06-08 [X] BUG: cursor don't change form in insert.
	:> urxvt don't have 'vbar' cursor

TEST
	[_] Check :wa! with dirty new buffer in vim w/o file to save
		: to implement autosaving on FocusOut
	[_] FIXME: erasing changes scenario
		copied in clipboard, pressed $mSd+X, clipboard edited, change focus from vim
			as result my edits will be replaced with current @" content
